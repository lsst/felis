YAML Schema Definition Language for Databases

Overview
--------

Felis implements a `YAML <https://yaml.org/>`_ data format for describing
database schemas in a way that is independent of implementation
language and database variant. These schema definitions can be checked for
validity using an internal `Pydantic <https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/>`_ data
model to ensure strict conformance to the format. SQL Data Definition language
(DDL) statements can be generated to instantiate corresponding database
objects, such as tables and columns, in a number of different database
variants, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite. The schema can also
be used to update the TAP schema information in a
`TAP <https://www.ivoa.net/documents/TAP/>`_ service.

The tool was developed internally by the
`Vera C. Rubin Observatory <https://rubinobservatory.org/>`_ as a way of
defining a "single source of truth" for database schemas and their metadata
which are maintained for the facility in the
`sdm_schemas github repository <https://github.com/lsst/sdm_schemas>`_. Though
developed in the context of astronomical data management and including some
optional features that are specific to
`IVOA standards <https://www.ivoa.net/documents/>`_, Felis is generic enough
that it can be used as a general tool to define, update, and manage database
schemas in a way that is independent of database variant or implementation
language such as SQL.
