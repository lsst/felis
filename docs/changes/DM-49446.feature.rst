The ``diff`` module was completely overhauled based on best practices for using the ``deepdiff`` library.
The formatted differences are now displayed in a JSON format, which is more readable and structured than the previous print outs.
A number of bugs and issues with the comparison logic and the display of the diffs were also fixed, improving the accuracy of the schema diffs.
The error handling in the database diff class was improved so that exception messages should be more informative and helpful.
A command line option has been added for writing the diff output to a file.
Finally, an additional command line option allows filtering only on specified tables in the two schemas being compared.
