Add support in the data model for optionally setting the ``ON UPDATE`` or ``ON DELETE`` actions of a foreign key constraint,
corresponding to the ``on_update`` and ``on_delete`` properties in the YAML file.
Valid values for these properties are covered in the `SQLAlchemy documentation <https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/core/constraints.html#on-update-on-delete>`__.
