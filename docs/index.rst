Felis
=====

Felis provides a system for describing astronomical data catalogs with a user-friendly YAML data format.
It covers not only the metadata required to create database schemas, but also a wide range of additional
information associated with IVOA standards and other applications.
While developed for the `Vera C. Rubin Observatory <https://rubinobservatory.org/>`__, which utilizes the
framework for describing its `Science Data Model Schemas <https://github.com/lsst/sdm_schemas>`__, Felis is
designed to be general enough to be used by any astronomical data provider.

Felis is developed on GitHub at https://github.com/lsst/felis and is available on `PyPI <https://pypi.org/>`__ as ``lsst-felis``.
